### Project Description

Food Basket is for free food and items.

Suppose you are at an event and at the end there are pizza slices left. Instead of it going to waste, you can share the food with the community or people near you. Food Basket allows you to snap a picture of the food, then give a description, such as building, room number, and quantity. Users nearby will receive a notification of the food and will have the chance to claim it. This same process also works with unwanted items such as furniture, books, and more.


- No "half eaten food" meaning no food that someone has taken a bite out of
- Leave food in a sanitary area
- Should be left in an area accessible by other users

### User Story

"I have fresh food that nobody wants and I don't want to throw it away."

"I have a chair that I don't need it but it could be useful for someone else."

"There's always leftovers food after the event, someone must want it."
